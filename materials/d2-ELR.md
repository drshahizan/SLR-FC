| 2. | **EvidenceHunt** | EvidenceHunt is an AI-powered clinical evidence search engine that helps healthcare professionals find the latest and most relevant evidence quickly and easily. It is based on a large dataset of clinical trials, systematic reviews, and other evidence sources, and uses artificial intelligence to identify and rank the most relevant results for each search query. | <a href="https://evidencehunt.com/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3. | **Semantic Scholar** | Semantic Scholar is a free AI-powered research tool that aggregates scientific literature from various fields of science, including nanotechnology and moral reasoning, and uses AI and engineering to understand the semantics of the research to help scholars discover relevant publications. | <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 4. | **R Discovery** | Comprehensive research platform that uses AI to help you find relevant literature, stay up-to-date on the latest research, and collaborate with other researchers. Powerful search engine that can be used to find papers by keyword, author, or topic. | <a href="https://discovery.researcher.life/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3. | **Publish or Perish** | Publish or Perish is a software program that retrieves and analyzes academic citations. It uses various publicly available data sources to obtain the raw citations, then analyzes these and calculates a series of citation metrics. The results are available on-screen and can also be copied to the Windows clipboard (for pasting into other applications) or saved to a text file (for future reference or further analysis). | <a href="https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |

| 5. | **Connected Papers** | Free tool that allows you to visually explore the relationships between different research papers. Creates a network graph where each node represents a paper and the edges between nodes represent citations. Helpful way to find new papers that are related to the research you are already familiar with. | <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 6. | **Consensus.app** | Consensus.app works by first extracting the key information from research papers. This information includes the paper's title, abstract, keywords, and main findings. The platform then uses AI to summarize this information into a concise and easy-to-understand format. | <a href="https://consensus.app/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 7. | **Elicit** | Elicit is an AI-powered tool that assists researchers in searching for relevant research papers. It uses advanced algorithms to analyse and understand the content of papers, making it easier to find specific information. Elicit uses language models to help you automate research workflows, like parts of literature review. | <a href="https://elicit.com/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 8. | **Humata AI** | Scopus is a citation index and abstracting service that indexes scholarly literature from a wide variety of sources, including peer-reviewed journals, books, conference proceedings, and datasets. | <a href="https://www.humata.ai/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 9. | **Inciteful** | The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help you map academic literature. It can be used in a variety of ways depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Start from seed paper(s), you can have an overview on the current state of that topic. Then, by adding more seed papers or filters, you can further craft the citation graph and have a focus on your search. If you are writing a paper, you can import the items in your reference list to Inciteful, and the resulting graph should be centered around the paper you are writing.  | <a href="https://inciteful.xyz/" width="24px" height="24px" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a></a> |
| 10. | **scite.ai** | Scite.ai is a AI-powered platform that helps researchers evaluate the credibility of research papers. It does this by analyzing the citations of a paper and comparing them to other papers in the same field. One of its most helpful features is its ability to identify and summarize relevant sections of papers based on your search query.| <a href="https://scite.ai/" ><img src="../images/article.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3. | **Publish or Perish** | Publish or Perish is a software program that retrieves and analyzes academic citations.
