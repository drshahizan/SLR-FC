# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Reporting the Results of the Review

The last step in the procedure entails summarizing the review's findings and presenting them in a clear, succinct manner. This is known as reporting the results of the SLR. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should all be able to access and comprehend the results when they are presented.</p>

### i. Organizing the Results
The first step in reporting the results is to organize the information in a logical and easy-to-follow manner. This may involve using headings and subheadings, tables, and figures to summarize the key findings. The results should be presented in a way that is clear and concise, and that accurately reflects the findings of the review.

Steps for organizing the results in a systematic literature review (SLR)

| System | Strengths                           | Weaknesses                   |
|:--------:|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| A      | High availability, low latency      | Low data storage capacity   |
| B      | High data storage capacity          | High cost, low scalability  |
| C      | High scalability, low cost          | Low availability, high latency |

### ii. Including Key Information
It's crucial to include vital details in the report, such as the review's history, its methodologies, the findings of the studies' quality assessment, and a summary of the conclusions. A discussion of the results' implications and any data constraints should also be included in the report.

Steps for including key information in a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Steps                                       | Example |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Identify the information to include in the table | Relevant information such as the study's authors, publication year, methodology, results, and conclusions  |
| 2. Organize the information in a logical and clear format | Use a tabular format, where each study is represented in a separate row and each column represents a specific piece of information (e.g., authors, year, methodology, results, conclusions) |
| 3. Ensure that the table is easy to read and comprehend | Use clear and concise language, use headings and subheadings, ensure that the information is visually separated, and consider using shading or color to emphasize important information |
| 4. Highlight key findings                    | Use bold or italic text, use symbols or icons, or highlight findings that are particularly relevant to the research question |

Example:

Example for Key Information
| Study   | Authors       | Publication Year | Methodology    | Results                                                   | Conclusions |
|:---------:|---------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Study 1 | Smith et al.  | 2020              | Qualitative    | Results showed that users preferred a more personalized experience with technology | Concluded that personalization is crucial for user satisfaction with technology |
| Study 2 | Jones et al.  | 2021              | Quantitative   | Results indicated that users have a strong desire for technology that is easy to use and understand | Concluded that usability is a key factor in user satisfaction with technology |
| Study 3 | Davis et al.  | 2022              | Mixed Methods   | Results showed that users value technology that is both personalized and easy to use | Concluded that both personalization and usability are important factors in user satisfaction with technology |

### iii. Ensuring Transparency
When presenting the results of an SLR, transparency is essential, and it's important to make sure that the steps taken and the outcomes of the study's quality assessment are clearly described. As a result, the conclusions will be more reliable and valid, and other academics will be able to gauge the quality of the review.</p>

Steps for ensuring transparency in reporting the results of a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                                        | Example (Computer Science)                                                               |
|:------:|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Define the purpose of transparency                | The purpose of transparency in the SLR is to ensure that the review process is open, accountable and can be easily followed by others.                     |
| 2    | Identify potential sources of bias                 | Potential sources of bias in the SLR process include researcher experience, study design, and funding source.                                            |
| 3    | Document the review process                        | The review process should be documented in detail including the research question, inclusion and exclusion criteria, search strategies and quality assessment methods. |
| 4    | Include all relevant studies                       | All relevant studies, regardless of the results, should be included in the SLR to ensure that the findings are representative of the available evidence.         |
| 5    | Provide details on data extraction and synthesis   | Detailed information on data extraction and synthesis should be provided, including the methods used and any decisions made during the process.               |
| 6    | Present results clearly and objectively            | The results of the SLR should be presented clearly and objectively, with any limitations or sources of bias clearly identified.                               |
| 7    | Make all data and materials available               | All data and materials used in the SLR should be made available to ensure that the findings can be independently verified.                                  |

### Example in Computer Science

Example: In a computer science SLR investigating the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for image classification, the following transparency measures could be taken:

<ul>
  <li>Clearly documenting the research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria</li>
  <li>Providing detailed information on the search strategies used to identify relevant studies</li>
  <li>Presenting a comprehensive summary of all studies included, including their methods, results, and limitations</li>
  <li>Making all data and materials used in the SLR, such as the search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data extraction forms, available to others.</li>
</ul>

In conclusion, reporting the results of an SLR is an important step in the process, and requires careful planning and attention to detail. By organizing the information in a logical and easy-to-follow manner, including key information, and ensuring transparency, researchers can ensure that their SLR makes a valuable contribution to the field and that their findings are accessible and understandable to a wide audience.
