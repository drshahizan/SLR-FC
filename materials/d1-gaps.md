# AI Tools for Identifying Research Gaps

| **AI Tool** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|**[LitMaps](https://www.litmaps.com/)**|This tool creates visual maps of research topics based on AI analysis of scholarly articles. These maps can reveal under-explored areas within the topic.|
| **[SciSpace](https://typeset.io/)** | Offers AI tools for literature review, including finding new, connected papers using a visual graph. |
| **[Research Rabbit](https://www.researchrabbit.ai/)** | Research Rabbit is a research discovery tool that helps you find new, connected papers using a visual graph. You can essentially create maps around metadata, which helps you not only explore similar papers but also connections between them.  |
| **[Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)** | Offers AI-powered "augmented reader" to analyze research paper structure, highlight key information, and connect to relevant articles, revealing potential areas for further study. | 
| **[Scite](https://scite.ai/partners/publishers)** | Analyzes the quality and credibility of research papers. While not directly identifying gaps, Scite's analysis of existing research limitations can point researchers towards areas needing more information or investigation. |
| **[HyperWrite's](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/aitools/ai-literature-review-generator)** | HyperWrite's AI Literature Review Generator is a revolutionary tool that automates the process of creating a comprehensive literature review.
