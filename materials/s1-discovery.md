# Paper Discovery

| No.  | Name | Description | Info | Tools |
|------: | ------------------|-----|:--------:|:--------:|
| 1. | Connected Papers | Connected Papers works by analyzing the citations between research papers. This allows it to create a network of papers that are connected to each other. The network can be used to explore the connections between different papers, identify gaps in the literature, and find new research opportunities. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/connected-papers" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 2. | R Discovery | R Discovery is a revolutionary app designed for students and researchers, offering a seamless experience in discovering and reading research papers. This literature search and reading app tailors an academic reading library to your interests, ensuring you stay abreast of the latest academic research through scholarly articles, scientific journals, open access content, and peer-reviewed papers. With R Discovery, your literature search is simplified, allowing you to explore like on Google Scholar, refseek, Research Gate, or Academia.edu, or opt for our AI-generated feeds of pertinent scholarly articles. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/r-discovery" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://discovery.researcher.life/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 3. | Humata AI | Scopus is a citation index and abstracting service that indexes scholarly literature from a wide variety of sources, including peer-reviewed journals, books, conference proceedings, and datasets. |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/humata-ai" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.humata.ai/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 4. | Litmaps | Litmaps is a tool that uses natural language processing and machine learning to help users visualize the relationships between different papers. It can be used to identify gaps in the literature, to find new papers that are relevant to a research topic, and to collaborate with others.|<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/litmaps" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.litmaps.com/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 5. | ResearchRabbit| ResearchRabbit is a literature mapping platform that takes one or more relevant seed papers and uses various algorithms to suggest and visualize relevant literature and researchers.  |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/researchrabbit" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://www.researchrabbit.ai/" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> |
| 6. | Inciteful | The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help you map academic literature. It can be used in a variety of ways depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Start from seed paper(s), you can have an overview on the current state of that topic. Then, by adding more seed papers or filters, you can further craft the citation graph and have a focus on your search. If you are writing a paper, you can import the items in your reference list to Inciteful, and the resulting graph should be centered around the paper you are writing.  |<a href="https://drshahizan.gitbook.io/ai-tools/ai-tools/paper-discovery/inciteful" ><img src="../images/rfp.png" width="24px" height="24px" ></a> | <a href="https://inciteful.xyz/" width="24px" height="24px" ><img src="../images/download.gif" width="24px" height="24px" ></a></a> |
