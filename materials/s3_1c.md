# How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?

## Appraising the Quality of the Studies

An important part of doing an SLR is assessing the caliber of the research, which entails assessing the caliber of each study that was included in the review. This phase helps to reduce the risk of deriving the wrong conclusions from low-quality studies and helps to guarantee that the review's findings are supported by high-quality studies.

### i. Determining Quality Criteria
Choosing the quality standards to be applied is the first stage in evaluating the studies' level of quality. These guidelines should be based on acknowledged practices in the field and pertinent to the sort of study being conducted. For a randomized controlled trial, the appropriate sample size, the allocation concealment mechanism, and the blinding of participants and outcome assessors might all be considered as quality criteria.

Steps for determining quality criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                         | Example |
|:------:|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose a Quality Assessment Tool    | Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale    |
| 2    | Define Quality Criteria              | Relevance, validity, reliability, generalizability, and objectivity |
| 3    | Assess Each Study                   | Evaluate the study based on the chosen quality assessment tool and the defined quality criteria |
| 4    | Record Results                      | Record the results of the quality assessment for each study in a consistent and systematic manner |
| 5    | Evaluate the Overall Quality of the Studies | Based on the quality assessment results, evaluate the overall quality of the studies included in the review |

By following these steps, you can ensure that the studies included in your SLR are of high quality, and that the results of the review are valid and trustworthy. This will help to increase the credibility and impact of your review.

### ii. Appraising the Studies
The next stage is to evaluate each reviewed research in light of the quality standards. In order to do this, a conventional quality evaluation tool or a unique tool created especially for the review may be used. Each study's quality should be systematically recorded, and the final report should contain a summary of the quality findings.

Summarizing the steps for appraising the studies for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                      | Example |
|:------:|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose an Appraisal Tool         | CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) or AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) |
| 2    | Define Appraisal Criteria         | Relevance, validity, reliability, generalizability, and objectivity |
| 3    | Appraise Each Study               | Evaluate each study based on the chosen appraisal tool and the defined appraisal criteria |
| 4    | Record Results                    | Record the results of the appraisal for each study in a consistent and systematic manner |
| 5    | Evaluate the Overall Quality of the Studies | Based on the appraisal results, evaluate the overall quality of the studies included in the review |

By following these steps, you can ensure that the studies included in your SLR are critically evaluated and that the results of the review are valid and trustworthy. This will help to increase the credibility and impact of your review.

### iii. Assessing Risk of Bias
Another crucial component of evaluating the studies' quality is determining the risk of bias. This entails analyzing the potential sources of bias in every study and determining how they might affect the findings. For instance, in a randomized controlled trial, sources of bias could include the selective presentation of data or the lack of participant and outcome assessor blinding.

Summarizing the steps for assessing the risk of bias in studies for a systematic literature review (SLR)

| Step | Description                              | Example |
|:------:|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Choose a Risk of Bias Tool               | Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool or Newcastle-Ottawa Scale |
| 2    | Define Risk of Bias Criteria              | Selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting, and other bias |
| 3    | Assess Risk of Bias for Each Study       | Evaluate each study based on the chosen risk of bias tool and the defined risk of bias criteria |
| 4    | Record Results                          | Record the results of the risk of bias assessment for each study in a consistent and systematic manner |
| 5    | Evaluate the Overall Risk of Bias        | Based on the risk of bias results, evaluate the overall risk of bias of the studies included in the review |

These steps will help you recognize and evaluate the potential sources of bias in the studies that make up your SLR. This will improve the validity and dependability of your review's findings.

In conclusion, an important step in doing an SLR is evaluating the caliber of the studies. Researchers may make sure that the findings of their SLR are based on high-quality studies and that they are able to draw meaningful conclusions about their area of interest by utilizing quality standards and assessing the possibility of bias. By doing this, they may make sure that their SLR makes a significant contribution to the field and contributes to the legitimacy and reliability of their findings.
