# Session 3

## How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review?
### Part 1:
1. [Preparation](s3_1a.md)
2. [Searching for Studies](s3_1b.md)
3. [Appraising the Quality of the Studies](s3_1c.md)
4. [Synthesizing the Results of the Studies](s3_1d.md)
5. [Reporting the Results of the Review](s3_1e.md)
6. [Writing the Conclusion](s3_1f.md)

### Part 2:
1. [How do I Deal with Missing Data in my SLR?](s3_1g.md)
2. [Zotero and SLR](s3_zotero.md)

#### Summary
An SLR is a formal way of synthesising the information available from primary studies relevant to a set of research questions. It follows a strict methodological framework with a set of well-defined steps carried out in accordance with a predefined protocol. Here are some possible steps for your exercise:

1. **Formulate a clear and specific research question** that you want to answer with your SLR. For example, "What are the benefits and challenges of using agile methods in software development?"¹ or "What are the current techniques being used to improve the efficiency of sorting algorithms in computer science?"¹².

2. **Develop a review protocol** that describes the objectives, methods, and criteria for your SLR. You can use a template such as [this one](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rodrigo-Silva-20/publication/320704338_Systematic_Literature_Review_in_Computer_Science_-_A_Practical_Guide/links/59f631caaca272607e2bc1c1/Systematic-Literature-Review-in-Computer-Science-A-Practical-Guide.pdf?origin=publication_detail) to guide you. The protocol should include the following elements:
    - The research question and its rationale
    - The search strategy and sources
    - The inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting studies
    - The quality assessment criteria and process for evaluating studies
    - The data extraction and synthesis methods and tools
    - The expected outcomes and dissemination plan
  
This includes defining the main research questions of the literature review, defining keywords, and defining the search string¹². For instance, the keywords could be "sorting algorithms", "efficiency", "computer science", and the search string could be "(sorting algorithms) AND (efficiency) AND (computer science)"².

3. **Search for relevant studies** using the search strategy and sources defined in your protocol. You can use electronic databases such as ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science to find articles in computer science. You can also use search engines such as [Google Scholar] and [Microsoft Academic] to complement your search. You should record the search terms, dates, and results for each source.
4. **Screen the studies** based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in your protocol. You can use a tool such as [Rayyan] to help you with this step. You should apply the criteria to the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the studies, and document the reasons for excluding any study. You should also report the number of studies included and excluded at each stage using a flow diagram..
5. **Assess the quality of the studies** based on the quality assessment criteria and process defined in your protocol. You can use a checklist such as [this one] to help you with this step. You should rate the quality of each study and justify your rating. You should also report the quality scores and distribution of the studies using a table or a chart.
6. **Extract the data** from the studies based on the data extraction and synthesis methods and tools defined in your protocol. You can use a spreadsheet such as [this one] to help you with this step. You should extract the relevant information from each study, such as the authors, title, year, publication type, research method, research question, findings, and implications. You should also synthesize the data using a method such as narrative synthesis, meta-analysis, or thematic analysis, depending on your research question and the type of data.
7. **Write and publish a report** that presents the results and conclusions of your SLR. You can use a template such as [this one] to guide you. The report should include the following sections:
    - Introduction: Provide the background, motivation, and aim of your SLR.
    - Method: Describe the protocol and process of your SLR, including the search strategy, selection criteria, quality assessment, data extraction, and data synthesis.
    - Results: Present the main findings and outcomes of your SLR, such as the number and characteristics of the studies, the quality scores and distribution of the studies, the data synthesis and analysis, and the answers to your research question.
    - Discussion: Interpret and discuss the results and implications of your SLR, such as the strengths and limitations of the evidence, the gaps and challenges in the research area, the implications for practice and policy, and the directions for future research.
    - Conclusion: Summarize the main points and contributions of your SLR, and provide a clear and concise answer to your research question.
    - References: List the sources that you cited in your report, using a consistent and appropriate citation style.
